FBIDFinder(.com)
-----------------------------------

**FBIDFinder** is a part of [Batuhan's Labs](http://labs.batu.me/ "Labs Homepage") and is a tool which simply finds a persons or pages ID on Facebook.

It uses Facebook's Graph API to retrieve information (ID, name, likes, profile picture and few more) and stores (soon!) that information.

I'll (@batuhanicoz) be developing this tool and will extend it's features. Until then, it's just a simple tool which does what it suppose to do.

###### Notes:
*- This tool uses Twitter's Bootstrap and SensioLabs' Silex PHP Framework (with Twig Extension)
- This tool is supported by owner of Gplus.to, Şirzat Aytaç.
